      <h1>what is reverse engineering?</h1>
      <p>Reverse engineering is the process of deducing how a device, system, or software works by analyzing its components and functionality, often with little prior knowledge. It can aid in repurposing outdated technology, conducting security analysis, and enhancing understanding of how something operates.</p>
